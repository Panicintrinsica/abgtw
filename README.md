# ABGGTW.Info
A progressive web application built in Angular to provide more comprehensive information about the _Above & Beyond Group Therapy Weekenders_ for concert-goers.

The primary impetus for this project was to address the vague, sometimes conflicting, and disparate information about how to prepare for the Washington State Weekender by providing guides, checklists, and answers to the questions that are most frequently asked up in the official ABGT Discord, such as more specific information about the food available, climate, differences between camping options, travel, and more.

# Note
This project is currently in development and is being rewritten from the ground up. This is **not** the currently live version on abgtw.info, that is the old, semi-broken prototype that was used as an example for the target audience.
